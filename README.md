This is a plugin for [ProcessMaker - the leading open source business process management suite](http://www.processmaker.com).

This plugin was used for a webinar that showed an example of creating a custom REST API endpoint in ProcessMaker that not only executed a case within ProcessMaker but it also connected to the Twilio api to send an sms through the workflow.

To watch the webinar, please go to the [ProcessMaker website to download the video](http://www.processmaker.com/webinar).
